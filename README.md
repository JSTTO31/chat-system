<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![Swift chat screenshot][./public/screenshot.png]](https://github.com/JSTTO31/chat-system)

SwiftChat represents a student-driven endeavor aimed at studying and implementing real-time communication features within a chat system. Developed by students passionate about exploring the dynamics of instant messaging and voice/video calls, SwiftChat serves as a learning platform and practical exploration of modern communication technologies.

Key Learning Objectives:
* Real-Time Messaging: SwiftChat delves into the intricacies of real-time messaging, studying protocols and techniques to ensure instant message delivery and synchronization.

* Voice/Video Calls: Students explore the complexities of implementing voice and video call functionality, studying protocols like WebRTC and examining the challenges of real-time media streaming.

* User Interface Design: SwiftChat incorporates principles of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, allowing students to create an intuitive and engaging platform for seamless communication.

* Backend Development: The project involves backend development to support real-time communication, exploring technologies like WebSocket for establishing persistent connections.

SwiftChat isn't just a project; it's a reflection of my journey as a student, a reminder of the endless possibilities that await when passion meets perseverance. And as I continue to chart my path, I'm excited to see where the lessons learned from SwiftChat will take me, knowing that the adventure has only just begun.
